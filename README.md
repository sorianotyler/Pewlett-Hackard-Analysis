# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of Project
 The objective of this project is to determine the number of retiring employees per title at Pewlett-Hackard, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
### Purpose
    The purpose of this challenge was to use SQL to quickly gather our data and report them to upper management for decision making.

 
## Results 
- The two positions with the most workers who are close to retirement are the Senior Engineers and the Senior staff.
- Only 1549 qualify for the Mentorship program 
- Only 2 managers are close to retirement. 
- The company will need to hire 72,458.
   
## Summary 
- To make more sense of this Data, the next step is to make a table to see the amount of mentors per title. This would allow us to see which areas of the business need the most attention.
- I would also run a queary to see the total salaries of all the employees hwo would retire. This will give me an idea of the budget we will have for new hires as the older generations begins to leave.
